# CS349-SP
Semester Project for CS349- Audio Mastering

To run the Applet version of this project with the "appletviewer", you must add the following line to the 
jre/lib/security/java.policy file:
    permission javax.sound.sampled.AudioPermission "record";

This is not necessary to run the Application version, or to run the Applet directly in Eclipse.
